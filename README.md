Clojure provides the [`clojure`](https://clojure.org/guides/deps_and_cli)
command line tool for:

- Running an interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)
- Running Clojure programs
- Evaluating Clojure expressions

The `clojure` tool is written in bash. This is a port of that tool written in
Clojure itself.

## Quickstart

``` shellsession
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/deps.clj/master/install) /tmp
$ /tmp/deps.exe
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

## Rationale

If your `clojure` installation works well for you, then you don't need
this. It's awesome and has been serving me well for years.

Reasons why I made this:

- The port was done as proof of concept for
  [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/). The entire bash script was
  ported to Clojure succesfully and runs just as fast with `bb`.

- This offers an arguably easier way to get going with `deps.edn` based projects
  in CI. Just curl an installer script and run. Works on both linux and macOS
  operating systems. I could not get the official installer script working on
  CircleCI with macOS and brew was too slow.

- Windows users might find the `deps.exe` executable of value if they have
trouble getting their system up and running. It works with `cmd.exe` unlike the
current Powershell based approach.

- This repo might be a place to experiment with features that are not available
in the original `clojure` command. Most notably it offers an `-Scommand` option
which allows other programs to be started than just the JVM version of Clojure,
e.g. `[babashka]`(https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/) or
`[planck]`(https://github.com/planck-repl/planck/).

- Arguably bash and Powershell are less attractive languages for Clojure
developers than Clojure itself. This repo provides the `clojure` bash script as
a port in Clojure. It can be used as a binary, script (`deps.clj`), uberjar
or library.

- This repo can be seen as a proof of concept of what is possible with GraalVM
and Clojure.

## Status

Experimental, but in a usable state. Breaking changes might happen to the non-standard functionality. Feedback and PRs are welcome.

## Installation

### Binary

The binary version of deps.clj, called `deps.exe`, only requires a working
installation of `java`.

#### Manual download

Binaries for linux, macOS and Windows can be obtained on the [Github
releases](https://github.com/borkdude/deps.clj/releases) page.

#### Linux and macOS

Install using the installation script on linux or macOS:

``` shell
$ bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/deps.clj/master/install) /tmp
$ /tmp/deps.exe
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

#### Windows

On Windows, you might want to install `deps.clj` using
[scoop](https://github.com/littleli/scoop-clojure).  When you get a message
about a missing `MSVCR100.dll`, also install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
Redistributable Package
(x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=14632) which is
also available in the
[extras](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/blob/master/bucket/vcredist2010.json)
Scoop bucket.

#### Script

The script, `deps.clj`, requires a working installation of `java` and
additionally [`bb`](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/) or `clojure`.

It can simply be downloaded from this repo:

``` shell
$ curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/borkdude/deps.clj/master/deps.clj -o /tmp/deps.clj
$ chmod +x /tmp/deps.clj
$ bb /tmp/deps.exe
Clojure 1.10.1
user=>
```

### Tools jar

This project will look in `$HOME/.deps.clj/ClojureTools` for
`clojure-tools.jar`. If it cannot it find it there, it will try to download it
from [this](https://download.clojure.org/install/clojure-tools-1.10.1.492.zip)
location. You can override the location of the jar with the `CLOJURE_TOOLS_CP`
environment variable.

## Non-standard options

The `deps.clj` script adds the following non-standard options:

```
 -Sdeps-file    Use this file instead of deps.edn
 -Scommand      A custom command that will be invoked. Substitutions: {{classpath}}, {{main-opts}}.
```

### Example usage

Given this `script-deps.edn` file:

``` clojure
{:paths ["scripts"]
 :aliases
 {:main
  {:main-opts ["-m" "scripts.main"]}}}
```

and `scripts/main.cljc`:

``` clojure
(ns scripts.main)

(defn -main [& _args]
  (println "Hello from script!"))
```

you can invoke `deps.clj` as follows to invoke
[babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/):

``` shell
$ deps.clj -Sdeps-file script-deps.edn -A:main -Scommand "bb -cp {{classpath}} {{main-opts}}"
Hello from script!
```

This can also be used with [planck](https://github.com/planck-repl/planck):

``` shell
$ deps.clj -Sdeps-file script-deps.edn -A:main -Scommand "planck --classpath {{classpath}} {{main-opts}}"
Hello from script!
```
